The Unix Philosophy
From The UNIX Programming Environment (1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and
techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes
it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the
computer. Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence,
at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the
relationships among programs than from programs themselves. Many UNIX programs
do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs,
become general and useful tools.
