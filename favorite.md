Manipulating Text

My favorite text editor is Vi, followed by emacs. I like the two different modes in Vi (command and insert mode) because it means there is less room to make mistakes. Also the commands are very intuitive. However, I found it weird how you are able to delete things in command mode using the delete key. My only complaint would probably be that when you searched for strings in Vi command mode, the keywords are not color-coded, which I found extremely helpful in emacs.
